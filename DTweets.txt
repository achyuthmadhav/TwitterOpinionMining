2829. Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"
*************************************************************
2830. The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
*************************************************************
2831. Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
*************************************************************
2832. Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
*************************************************************
2833. Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
*************************************************************
2834. The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!
*************************************************************
2835. I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
*************************************************************
2836. The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
*************************************************************
2837. If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
*************************************************************
2838. The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
*************************************************************
2839. Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
*************************************************************
2840. I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.
*************************************************************
2841. The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
*************************************************************
2842. I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,

2847. Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
*************************************************************
2848. I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
*************************************************************
2849. The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
*************************************************************
2850. Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!
*************************************************************
2851. The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!
*************************************************************
2852. The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior
*************************************************************
2853. Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

2859. Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!
*************************************************************
2860. I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice
*************************************************************
2861. Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
*************************************************************
2862. The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?
*************************************************************
2863. Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.

*************************************************************
2872. Fidel Castro is dead!
*************************************************************
2873. The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems
*************************************************************
2874. The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!
*************************************************************
2875. Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
*************************************************************
2876. Hillary's debate answer on delay: "That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free --

*************************************************************
2881. Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead." So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad
*************************************************************
2882. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
*************************************************************
2883. It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--
*************************************************************
2884. states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!
*************************************************************
2885. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!
*************************************************************
2886. If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.

2892. .@CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do.
*************************************************************
2893. The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!
*************************************************************
2894. I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!
